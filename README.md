# Stock-Price-prediction
Our project employs AI/ML techniques and LSTM algorithm to predict stock prices, aiming to assist investors in making informed decisions and avoiding unreliable sources. We created a Flask-based web application using HTML and CSS, deployed on Google Cloud. Figma was used for UI/UX design and Putty for remote server access.
