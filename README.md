# Project Name: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM V1

## Project Description
This project uses deep learning techniques to predict stock prices using LSTM algorithm. The goal is to help investors make informed decisions and prevent them from being misled by unreliable sources. The web application is designed using Flask, HTML, CSS, and deployed on Google Cloud.


## Team Members
- [P.V.Chaitanya](https://github.com/pvchaitanya8/) : Helped for building data set & preprocessing, and assisting tarining and testing the Deeplearning Model.
- [Deva Sai Kishore](https://github.com/devasaikishore43) : Helped in cloud deployment.
- [Siva Shankar](https://github.com/SivaShankar-Juthuka) : Helped in training & testing the deep learning model and also assisting with tasks such as data preprocessing.
- [Uday Kiran]() : Helped for Designing front end.
