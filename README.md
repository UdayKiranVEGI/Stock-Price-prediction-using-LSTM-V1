# Project Name: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM [V2]

## Project Description
This project uses deep learning techniques to predict stock prices using LSTM algorithm. The goal is to help investors make informed decisions and prevent them from being misled by unreliable sources. The [web application](http://34.16.129.157:5000/) is designed using Flask, HTML, CSS, and deployed on Google Cloud.


## Team Members
- [P.V.Chaitanya](https://github.com/pvchaitanya8/) : Helped for building the data set and preprocessing, and assisting in training and testing the Deeplearning Model LSTM. Assisted in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. Conducted comprehensive experiments, conducted rigorous analyses of the results
- [Deva Sai Kishore](https://github.com/devasaikishore43) : Helped in facilitating Google cloud deployment and by the help of docker, contributing to the successful implementation and utilization of cloud computing technologies.
- [Siva Shankar](https://github.com/SivaShankar-Juthuka) : Helped in bridging the gap between the backend and frontend by leveraging the power of Flask. and assisted in designing the front end of the project for optimized user interactions to enhance the overall usability of the application.
- [Uday Kiran](https://github.com/UdayKiranVEGI) : Helped in designing the front end of the project, leveraging my design expertise to create visually captivating and user-friendly interfaces.
